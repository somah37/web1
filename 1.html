    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) is a markup language[1] for creating a webpage. Webpages are usually viewed in a web browser. They can include writing, links, pictures, and even sound and video. HTML is used to mark and describe each of these kinds of content so the web browser can display them correctly. HTML can also be used to add meta information to a webpage. Meta information is usually not shown by web browsers and is data about the web page, e.g., the name of the person who created the page.

HTML was made by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). There are several versions of HTML. As of September 2018, the current standard of HTML is dubbed HTML 5 and is specifically at version 5.2.</p>
